# Number Guessing Game - Java
This repository contains the code for my internship task at Oasis Infobyte, where I worked on a Java programming project to create a number guessing game.

## Task Description
The task assigned to me was to develop a number guessing game using Java. The objective of the game is to guess a randomly generated number within a given range. The game provides hints to the player, such as whether the guessed number is higher or lower than the target number. The player continues guessing until they correctly identify the target number or reach the maximum number of attempts.

Throughout the project, I utilized my Java programming skills to implement the game logic, user interface, and input validation. I aimed to create an engaging and intuitive game experience for the player.

## Git Usage
During the development of this task, I utilized Git as a version control system to track and manage my code changes. Git allowed me to maintain a history of my progress, collaborate with my team, and easily push and pull code from a remote repository.

To push my changes to the remote repository, I used the following command:

git push -u -f origin master

This command forcefully pushed my local "master" branch to the remote repository named "origin," ensuring that my changes were reflected in the shared codebase. However, it's important to note that the "-f" option should be used with caution to avoid overwriting or discarding others' work.

##Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

 * src: This directory contains the source code files of the number guessing game.
 * README.md: This file provides an overview of the project and instructions on how to use and run the game.
Feel free to explore the repository to gain a deeper understanding of the project and the code I have written.

## Installation and Usage
To use or run this number guessing game, follow these steps:

Ensure that you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```
git clone <repository_url>
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd number-guessing-game
```
Compile the Java source code files:
```
javac src/*.java
```
Run the game:
```
java -cp src Main
```
Follow the on-screen instructions to play the number guessing game.

## Contribution
This internship task is complete, and no further contributions are expected. However, I welcome any feedback or suggestions you may have. If you encounter any issues or have questions, please feel free to open an issue in this repository.

Remember to replace <repository_url> in the instructions with the actual URL of your repository. Customize the README file further by providing additional information, such as game rules, design choices, or any other relevant details that you think would be helpful for others using or reviewing your code.
